"""Excercise:
    Write a function named readable_timedelta.
    The function should take one argument, an integer days,
    and return a string that says how many weeks and days that is.
    For example, calling the function and printing the result like this:
    print(readable_timedelta(10)) should output the following:
    1 week(s) and 3 day(s). (Make sure to use this exact format, including the . at the end.)
    Include a docstring that explains what the function does."""
